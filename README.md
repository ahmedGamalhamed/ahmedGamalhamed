### Hi, I am Ahmed Gamal

I love to work with Javascript/Typescript as It can be used to do pretty much anything.
From building websites with the aid of HTML and CSS, creaing automations and flows with puppeteer and chrome extensions, to doing backend logic and APIs using NodeJs.

I transitioned from being a civil engineer to become a developer as I Initially  was drawn to the efficiency of Excel functions and automating hours of work with few clicks, then I started a journey to develop a bot to purchase a GPU card during the BitCoin craze. This experience started my joruney in programming and web development, prompting me to transition into a career as a MERN stack developer, where it took me from self studying to freelancing to having a scholarship from ITI (Egypt), I continue along my path of following my passion

Freelancing was really a blessing for my knowledge as it forced me to expand beyond "normal" roles and techs and breaking the barrier of FE/BE devlopment and increase my understanding and usage of the entire stack as a whole
